\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:area-transect-intro}

Thus far, we have considered detecting individuals with various types
of equipment, including live-capture traps, cameras, hair snares,
microphones, and hydrophones. In each case, a single detector is
positioned at a \emph{discrete} point in space that can be represented
by a single pair of Cartesian coordinates. However, some species are
more readily detected by searching one or more areas, or by travelling
along one or more line transects. Such surveys can be conducted
through an active search by human surveyors travelling by foot
\citep[e.g.,][]{Royle+Young:08} or vehicle, \todo{Insert Conservation
  Biology paper I recently reviewed; should be online sometime soon}
or by using passive detection technologies such as satellites
\citep[e.g.,][]{Fretwell+al:14} or drones equipped with
high-definition video cameras
\citep[e.g.,][]{Stevenson+al:inprep}. \todo{Maybe this will be
  published before this book?} The surveys may attempt to find the
animals themselves, or \emph{cues} they leave behind that can somehow
be attributed to individuals. Examples of such cues include feces,
hair, footprints, nests, and burrows, where individual identification
may be possible through microsatellite DNA, or some other distinctive
feature(s) of the cues.

In this chapter, we introduce SCR models for area search and line
transect surveys. These surveys may consist of one or more occasions,
and, on each, one or more (potentially different) areas are searched
or line transects are travelled. Each such area or line transect can
be thought of as a detector.

The type of data we observe and the survey we require depends on
whether individuals or cues are the unit of detection:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the survey aims to physically detect the animals themselves,
  then it is usually only possible for each individual to be detected
  no more than once over the course of an occasion---in which case it
  is necessary for the survey to have multiple occasions in order to
  obtain spatial and temporal recaptures.
\item If the survey aims to detect cues from animals, then it is
  possible to detect cues from the same animal at multiple points in
  space, possibly all within the same searched area or transect, or
  across multiple such areas or transects---in which case a single
  occasion provides enough information to fit an SCR model.
\end{enumerate}
In both cases, any given area or transect may detect multiple
individuals in a single occasion. This means that it is \emph{not}
necessary to search more than one unique area or travel more than one
unique trasect---the exact location of each detection is recorded, and
so a single area or line transect can provide the spatial recaptures
that are required. The distinction above is equivalent to that seen
between multi-catch traps and proximity detectors in Chapter
\ref{chap:det-types}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item On a multi-catch trap survey, any given individual can only be
  detected by, at most, one detector, and multiple occasions are
  required.
\item On a proximity detector survey, individuals can be detected by
  any number of detectors, and may even be detected by the same
  detector numerous times.
\end{enumerate}

The SCR framework we have established is extended in Section
\ref{sec:area-transect-likelihood} for area and line transect survey
data. Specifically, methods for cue- and individual-based data are
presented in Sections \ref{sec:area-transect-cue} and
\ref{sec:area-transect-individual}, respectively, along with how the
\texttt{secr} package can be used to fit the corresponding models. If
there is spatial heterogeneity in either detectability or effort
across the areas or transects, then these methods must be extended;
this is presented in Section \ref{sec:area-transect-spatial}.

\section{The capture history likelihood component}
\label{sec:area-transect-likelihood}

As per Chapter \ref{chap:det-types}, the likelihood component that is
affected by the detection process is $[\bm{\Omega}_n | \bm{S}_n]$.
Many of the concepts discussed in previous chapters do not translate
directly across once the spatial nature of these detectors changes
from discrete (zero-dimensional) points to either one-dimensional line
transects or two-dimensional areas. For example, probabilities of
detection can no longer simply depend on the distance between an
activity centre and the point at which a detector is
deployed---instead, we must also consider the lengths of the line
transects and the paths they take, or the shapes and sizes of the
areas searched. Nevertheless, the SCR framework we have developed in
earlier chapters can be easily extended to neatly encompass the
modelling of data from such surveys.

On each of $K$ occasions, $J$ areas are searched or line transects are
travelled. Areas may take the shape of any polygon, and line transects
may follow any path. Let $A_j \subset R^2$ be the region enclosed by
the $j$th such polygon (for area searches) or the path taken by the
$j$th line transect (for line transects). Thus, $A_j$ is a
two-dimensional subspace of $R^2$ for area search surveys, and a
one-dimensional subspace of $R^2$ for line transect surveys.

In previous chapters, detectors have either provided binary or count
detection data, and this remains the same for area searches and line
transects: if cues are the detection unit then we observe
$\omega_{ijk}$ as a count of how many cues from the $i$th individual
were detected in the $j$th area or line transect on the $k$th
occasion, and if individuals are the detection unit then we observe
$\omega_{ijk}$ binary data indicating whether or not the $i$th
individual was detected in the $j$th area or transect on the $k$th
occasion (although recall only one such area or transect can detect a
particular individual on an occasion).

In addition to $\bm{\Omega}_n$, we also observe the precise location
that each detection was made within the areas or along the
transects. Let $\bm{y}_{ijk}$ contain all detection locations
associated with the $i$th individual in the $j$th area or transect on
the $k$th occasion, and let all such information be held in
$\bm{Y}_n$. This can be modelled as additional information (Section
\ref{sec:det-types-additional-data}), providing the likelihood
\begin{equation}
  [\bm{\Omega}_n, \bm{Y}_n | \bm{S}_n] = [\bm{\Omega}_n | \bm{S}_n] \times [\bm{Y}_1 | \bm{\Omega}_n, \bm{S}_n]. \nonumber
\end{equation}

Below we separately deal with the terms in the likelihood above for
cue- and individual-based surveys.


\subsection{Cue-based area search and line transect surveys}
\label{sec:area-transect-cue}

Models for area search and line transect surveys for which cues are
detection units behave similarly to those for proximity detector
surveys: (1) the same individual can be detected by multiple detectors
(i.e., areas or transects), (2) each detector can make multiple
detections of the same individual within the same occasion, and (3)
detection of one individual does not prevent detection of others
within the same occasion. As per Section
\ref{sec:det-types-proximity}, we assume independence between
individuals, detectors, and occasions, giving
\begin{equation}
  [\bm{\Omega}_n, \bm{Y}_n | \bm{S}_n] = \prod_{i = 1}^n \prod_{j = 1}^J \prod_{k = 1}^K [ \omega_{ijk} | \bm{s}_i] \times [\bm{y}_{ijk} | \omega_{ijk}, \bm{s}_i ]. \nonumber
\end{equation}
It is possible either $J = 1$ or $K = 1$, or both; that is, we can
estimate density when the data are from a survey with only a single
occasion, or if it constitutes only a single area or transect.

As before, here we conceptualise the encounter rate $\lambda_{ijk}$ as
the number of detections of the $i$th individual at the $j$th detector
(i.e., area or transect) on the $k$th occasion per unit time. This was
previously conceptualised as a function of distance between the
detector and the individual's activity centre, but this is no longer
possible once detectors are considered as areas or lines rather than
points.

Intuitively, more of an individual's cues are likely to be closer to
its activity centre. We can model this by treating the locations of
detected cues as a Poisson point pattern; refer to Section
\ref{sec:spmod-pps} for a summary of Poisson point processes. We do
this by fitting a \emph{cue intensity function}, $\Lambda(d)$ instead
of an encounter rate function, $\lambda(d)$. The former can take the
same parameters and thus has the same general set of functional forms
at the latter, but its interpretation is slightly different. Rather
than being the number of detections per unit time and a detector
located at a discrete point distance $d$ from an activity centre, it
is (1) the density of cues per unit area that are found upon a search
at distance $d$ from an activity centre for area searches, or (2) the
density of cues per unit distance of the transect travelled at
distance $d$ from an activity for line transects.

Let $d(\bm{x}, \bm{s})$ the distance between some location $\bm{x}$
and a hypothetical activity centre $\bm{s}$. Recall from Section
\ref{sec:spmod-pps} that the expected number of points generated by a
Poisson point process can be found by integrating over its
domain. Thus, for area searches, the number of cues we find from one
particular individual with activity centre $\bm{s}$ upon a total
search of its home range is a Poisson random variable with expectation
$\int_{R^2} \Lambda(d(\bm{x}, \bm{s})) d\bm{x}$.

Many areas may be searched over the course of an area search survey,
and these can take the shape of any polygon. Let the region of the
survey area enclosed by the $j$th such polygon be $\mathcal{A}_j$. The
expected number of cues found within $A_j$ can be determined by only
integrating over this region; that is, the expected number of the $i$th
individual's cues detected in the $j$th area on the $k$th occasion is
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_{ijk} = \int_{A_j} \Lambda(d(\bm{x}, \bm{s})) d\bm{x}.
  \nonumber
\end{equation}
The above also holds for line transect surveys, but the integral is
now a \emph{line integral}---it reperesents the area beneath the cue
intensity function along the path of the transect that is travelled.
As with proximity detectors, due to independence we obtain
\begin{equation}
  [ \bm{\omega}_{ijk} | \bm{s}_i ] = \mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_{ijk}). \nonumber
\end{equation}

\todo[inline]{Something that I have realised, which I think is a neat
  thing to point out: When detectors are {\bf two}-dimensional areas,
  then $\Lambda()$ is expected number of detetections per occasion per
  km$^\mathbf{2}$ searched and we need to evaluate a {\bf
    two}-dimensional integral to get $\lambda_{ijk}$. When detectors
  are {\bf one}-dimensional lines (i.e., transects), then $\Lambda()$
  is expected number of detections per occasion per km$^\mathbf{1}$
  travelled and we need to evaluate a {\bf one}-dimensional integral
  to get $\lambda_{ijk}$. When detectors are {\bf zero}-dimensional
  points, then $\Lambda()$ (or just $\lambda()$) is expected number of
  detetections per occasion per km$^\mathbf{0}$ (i.e., just detections
  per occasion) and we need to evaluate a {\bf zero}-dimensional
  integral to get $\lambda_{ijk}$ (i.e., we don't actually need to
  evaluate an integral at all). This is interesting to me as a
  statistician. But is it interesting to the reader?}

For each detection in the $j$th area or along the $j$th transect we
observe a detection location within $A_j$. From Chapter
\ref{chap:sppmod}, the probability density of a point's location is
proportional to the intensity function of its point
process. Therefore, assuming independence between the location of cues
given the individual's activity centre location, the likelihood
component due to locations of detections by the $j$th area or line
transect is
\begin{align}
  [ \bm{y}_{ijk} | \omega_{ijk}, \bm{s}_i ] &= \prod_{l =
    1}^{\omega_{ijk}} [ \bm{y}_{ijkl} | \omega_{ijkl}, \bm{s}_i ] \nonumber
  \\ &= \prod_{l = 1}^{\omega_{ijk}}\frac{\Lambda(d(\bm{y}_{ijkl},
    \bm{s}_i))}{\int_{A_j} \Lambda(d(\bm{x}, \bm{s}_i))
    d\bm{x}}, \hspace{2em} \bm{y}_{ijkl} \in A_j, \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\bm{y_{ijkl}}$ is the location of the $l$th detected cue from
the $i$th individual by the $j$th area or line transect on the $k$th
occasion. The denominator above ensures that $[ \bm{y}_{ijkl} |
  \omega_{ijkl}, \bm{s}_i ]$ is a valid PDF, in that it integrates to
1.
